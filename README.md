- hypothesis testing
- prediction interval and confidence interval
- assessing conditions
- transformation
- exploratory data analysis
- model selection metric (adjusted R^2, akaike information criterion, bayesian information criterion)

## Results
Results show that increasing price can negatively affect the sales volume, but promotion can effectively improve the sales volume.
